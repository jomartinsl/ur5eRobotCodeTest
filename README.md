I’m currently working on a summerjob were i'm going to make a UR5e robotarm to play chess vs a human.  


I’m looking for help to get connection the UR5e robotiqGripper to my computer. I'm writing the program in Python3. 
I have downloaded the ur_rtde package, and I've gotten the UR5e robot to move by code. The last thing i need now is to get the 
gripper to open and close. 

Ask me about deeper information about the project. I will be needing some support to make a great solution for the chess-playing part

Reach me on my e-mail: jomartinslaatten98@hotmail.com.
