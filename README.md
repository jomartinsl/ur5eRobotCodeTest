## Programming a chess playing robot arm, UR5e-robot arm.



### About the project
I'm going to program the ur5e to play chess on a DGT-board. Programming language is in Python3 and OS will be
Linux. The finished result will be a robot that can pick up every piece without issues and failures. 
The DGT board will be plugged into the computer and that's where we get the opponoments move from.
