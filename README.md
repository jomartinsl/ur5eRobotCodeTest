### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



Iâ€™m currently working on a summerjob were i'm going to make a UR5e robotarm to play chess vs a human.  

Iâ€™m currently learning to code in Python3, have some excperience in C# and C++. 

Iâ€™m looking for help to get connection to the robotarm and my computer. I'm writing the program in Python3. 
The robotarm should precisely pick up and put down the chess-pieces without ruining for the other pieces. 

Ask me about deeper information about the project.

Reach me on my e-mail: jomartinslaatten98@hotmail.com.
