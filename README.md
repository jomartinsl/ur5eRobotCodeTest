### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



Iâ€™m currently working on a summerjob. I'm going to make a robotarm play chess. We are using the ROS.  

Iâ€™m currently learning to code in Python3, have some excperience in C# and C++. 

Iâ€™m looking for help to get connection to the robotarm and my computer. The robotarm is supposed to grab the chesspieces

Ask me about deeper information ablut the project.

Reach me on my e-mail: jomartinslaatten98@hotmail.com.
